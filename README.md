# Artix-Linux-OpenRC-ZFS-iso
This is simply a default Artix Linux iso with zfs-dkms installed on it  for ease of installation, linux kernel artix 8.5.3. Wanted to upload it so yall dont have to go through the hassle of installing it every time you fuck up installing zfs for the 900th time (CANT GET THE FING  BOOTLOADER TO BOOT ZFS!), like I was. Anyways,. this isn't a shell script or installer, just simply an iso with the zfs kernel module  ready to be loaded so you can get started making your pool right  away. Please, let me know if it I did something wrong, very new to  linux.
